# Database_Lindenwood
A project in which the inventory of a food's store is managed. Checkout of items is provided if there is enough items in the inventory.
The connection was issued with PHP and the database was managed with MySQL. Rollbacks where required when the items in checkout where not found in the inventory. Items can be supplied as well as discarded. Recipees can be created which contain a set of food items regardless of there availability in the inventory.

Please access the <b></i>'SuperStore Server'</b></i> in order to view the code.

The database was hosted on University grounds with help of Dr. Blythe. 
Initial credentials have to be provided in order to have the project work.
